**"Classification of CR Images via Jet Equivalence Using Persistent Homology"**  
by Nuray G√ºl

## üìå Overview

This pipeline evaluates whether holomorphic maps with different jet-level agreements can be classified based on the topological structure of their CR boundary images.

The process includes:

1. Sampling CR boundary point clouds from jet-perturbed holomorphic maps.
2. Computing persistent homology features (Persistence Images, Betti curves).
3. Training classifiers (SVM, RF, MLP) to distinguish jet-equivalent classes.

## üóÇÔ∏è Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `generate_dataset.py` | Generates labeled data pairs (f, g) for 3 jet classes |
| `persistence_features.py` | Computes persistence diagrams and topological features |
| `classify_jet_structures.py` | Trains SVM, RF, MLP classifiers and reports metrics |
| `main.py` | Runs the full pipeline from data generation to evaluation |
| `confusion_matrix.png` | Visualization of classifier performance (included after running) |

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Install dependencies**:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib ripser persim scikit-learn
```

2. **Run the main pipeline**:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
- Generate 300 labeled CR samples across 3 jet classes
- Compute topological features
- Train and evaluate classifiers
- Save confusion matrix as `confusion_matrix.png`
